## Welcome to D&D5e Animations, a fully automated preset of animations and sound effects for Automated Animations and the D&D 5th Edition system in Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

[![Animate Your D&D World](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrVauxs/dnd5e-animations/9094a66b63cb4585eee0659fc4fe082b445cbfeb/Banner.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGqeqMLzey8 "Animate Your D&D World - D&D5e Animations for Foundry VTT")

Click the banner for the trailer! Note, most of the sound effects used in the video have been replaced.

## Overview

This module automatically configures Automated Animations with over 1,000 animation configurations tailored for modern D&D 5th Edition. It plays graphics and sounds whenever you activate abilities, spells, or items from official D&D sources, such as the 2024 Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, Monster Manual, and more. It uses the Patreon versions of JB2A and PSFX for its visuals and audio, though the free versions are supported to a limited extent. So if you just want to try out D&D5e Animations before supporting the creators on Patreon, feel free, and upgrade later if you like what you see and hear!

## Features

This module includes animation configurations for:

- Most mundane weapons (including renaissance, modern, and futuristic weapons)
- Many of the most popular abilities and class features
- The most common monster attacks, as well as actions for iconic creatures
- Spells from the Player's Handbook (both 2014 and 2024 versions)
- Spells from other D&D books such as Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and Xanathar's Guide to Everything
- Generic animations that may cover a variety of circumstances
- Over 1000 animation configurations in total!

## Installation

Just install it from the Foundry VTT Add-on Modules page and enable it in your game. A message will pop up asking you to update and shows you what changes will be made. Your custom animations will not be overwritten!

The Patreon versions of JB2A and PSFX are recommended. If you don't have them already, you can grab them below.
- JB2A [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/JB2A)
- PSFX [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/PeriSFX)

The free versions of JB2A and PSFX will work but there will be graphics and sounds that will be missing. You can use them if you just want to try D&D5e Animations first or if you're ok with missing out on the full experience. 

D&D5e Animations requires Automated Animations 5.0.10 and the DnD5e game system version 4.3.5. If you do not these versions or newer, you will not see it in the Manage Modules page. If you are still using an older D&D system version, I suggest installing D&D5e Animations version 1.7.1.

Version 2.0.0 and newer will recommended the installation of PSFX. The module will work without it, but sound effects will be missing from most animations.

Note - Some sound effects use wildcards that play random sound variants. These require players to have Use File Browser permissions under core settings. To enable this, open your world and go to Game Settings, Configure Settings, All or Core, Open Permission Configuration, make sure all roles have Use File Browser checked.

If you do not wish to have sound effects, you can turn them all off by going to Game Settings, Configure Settings, Sequencer, uncheck Enable Sounds (note, this is a per-player setting.)
